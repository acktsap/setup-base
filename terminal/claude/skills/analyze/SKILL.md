description: Analyze codebase for context understanding. Use when starting work on a new codebase or exploring unfamiliar code.

Analyze the codebase to build working context. Focus on what's needed to effectively contribute.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Architecture Overview
- Project structure and organization pattern
- Entry points and main execution flow
- Key directories and their responsibilities

### 2. Tech Stack & Dependencies
- Languages, frameworks, and major libraries
- Build system and tooling
- External services or APIs

### 3. Code Conventions
- Naming patterns (files, functions, variables)
- Code organization style
- Error handling approach
- Testing patterns if present

### 4. Key Abstractions
- Core data structures and models
- Important interfaces or base classes
- Shared utilities and helpers

### 5. Working Notes
- Non-obvious gotchas or quirks
- Areas of complexity to be aware of
- Implicit assumptions in the code

## Output Format

Use concise bullet points. Prioritize actionable insights over exhaustive documentation.
Structure output so it can be quickly scanned when returning to the codebase later.
